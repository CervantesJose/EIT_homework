# Week 2 Quiz Answers

Q - What is a TabBarController(what are its uses)?
A - A TabBarController is used to create a list of tabs on the bottom of the screen. Each tab has its own view within the app. This style of creating a tab view controller is extremely common in the app community. (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.)

Q - What is autoLayout?
A - autoLayout automatically lays out the constraints of elements	in a view accordingly

Q - What is a segue?
A - A segue is a connection between two separate views that then allows them to pass information or views to one another

Q - What methods are needed to build Tableviews?

	 2. numberOfSections(UITableView)
	 3. tableView(UITableView, Int) -> Int
	 4. tableView(UITableView, IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell.

Q - What is a closure?
A - Blocks of code within file that are references to functions or variables, similar to lambdas in other languages

Q - Are there any protocols we must conform to to build Tableviews?
A - TableViewDelegate is one I can think of that I’ve used. I’m sure there are more, depending on the situation

Q - Do you prefer to build your controllers in storyboard or programmatically?
A - At this point, since I am working on learning both I can’t say 100 percent but I can understand the appeal for each. I think after more practice I will lean towards building controllers programmatically.

Q - What is a CollectionView?
A - A CollectionView is similar to a TableView but differs by being more flexible in use for displaying a custom layout.

Q - How does a UINavigationController work (what does it do)?
A - The UINavigationController works by managing other view controllers. They allow for easier navigation between views (stacks views)

Q - Tell me about a time you had to work to overcome a particular engineering challenge?
A - One of my last classes in order to graduate from Colorado Mesa University was to be in a team and develop an app for a client. Our client was a very business oriented person who definitely had a vision for the app and it was our job to deliver. Often times, being the computer scientists that we are, (the team of students) would misunderstand his priorities and get sidetracked on things that didn’t matter. After about a month of zero progress on the app (in terms of moving it forward for business use) I got frustrated and decided to take charge of speaking with the client. Instead of focusing on the database to store user information which wasn’t one of his priorities, he and I decided the team should focus more on the geofencing of the trails we needed for the app to move forward. This was the first time of many where I would see the team start to overwhelm themselves on an unnecessary problem while there were real issues to be solved. In the end, we overcame the challenge of effective communication in order to finish the MVP we were looking to have done in time for GoCode Colorado. We ended up winning 3rd place and I couldn’t have been prouder of my team.
